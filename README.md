# ScribbleScramble

## `npm install` necessary in both the Server directory, and then again in the FrontEnd directories. 

## Starting our Servers
- We have 2 servers to start, front end and back end
  - Start back end server first —> from main ScribbleScramble directory: `cd Server` `node index.js`
  - Front end —> from main ScribbleScramble directory: `cd FrontEnd` `yarn start` / what we've already been doing
