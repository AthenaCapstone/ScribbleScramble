# ScribbleScramble

## `npm install` necessary in both the Server directory, and then again in the FrontEnd directories.

## Do not use yarn!!

## Starting our Servers
We have two servers: front end + back end. To start:
- Back end ONLY (from **root directory**):  `npm start`
- Front end ONLY: `cd Front End` -> `npm start`
- BOTH Front end + Back end: `npm start-dev` (*with nodemon*)
