# ScribbleScramble

## `npm install` necessary in both the Server directory, and then again in the FrontEnd directories.

## Do not use yarn!!

## Starting our Servers
- We have 2 servers to start, front end and back end.
  - Front End: `cd FrontEnd` && `npm start`
  - Back End: **two** options (from root ScribbleScramble directory)
    - *with nodemon*: `npm start-dev`
    - *without nodemon*: `npm start`
